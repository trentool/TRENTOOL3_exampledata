TRENTOOL - EXAMPLE DATA

This folder contains example data to demonstrate the basic use of the 
TRENTOOL toolbox. Every folder contains one or several data sets 
(.mat-files) together with an analysis script ('analyze_*.m'), a plotting 
script ('plot_*.m'), and a simulation script ('simulate_*.m') if 
applicable.

Note that you may need to adjust the paths used in the example scripts. 
Furthermore, all analysis scripts expect an output folder in your home 
directory. Make sure you have created the respective folder before you 
start an example analysis.

More information regarding individual examples can be found in the MATLAB
help of each script.
